### 🎤 hey
Name's **Brayan**, nice of you to stumble in here.

Here's a quick rounddown of my coding interests. I'm -
- 💻 Interested in **Python**, **TypeScript**, **Java**, and **C#** primarily - but open to others.
- 🌱 Currently learning more about web frameworks and .NET Blazor.
- 🤝 Open to collaborate on **web-based** or **back-end** projects.
- 📬 Feel free to email me @ **brayan.cova@outlook.com** for any questions.
- 🎶 Fun Fact - I'm a fan of jazz, and have performed trumpet for my college's jazz band before graduating, although trombone will remain my primary instrument. Looking to add piano next on my list.
